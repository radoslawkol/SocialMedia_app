# BeConnected - Social media app
This is a social media app, mainly desing was inspired by facebook.
[See BeConnected app](https://playful-seahorse-fb65aa.netlify.app/)


## My motivation

I wanted to create a big project to my portfolio and something, which I could be pround of. Recentely I haved learned React and dug deeper in Express. 
I thought that creating a social media app would be sth cool and I could practice on bigger project, where I had to connect frontend and backend.

## What problem does it solve?

The main idea of the app was to assure users a place, in which they can communicate with friends and others.

**Main Functionalities:**

- Create an account
- Creating posts
- Real time chatting with other users
- Adding friends
- Update profile(picture, cover, bio, details)
- Writting comments
- Reacting to posts
- Getting notifications
- Setting color theme(light/dark)
- Getting upcomming friends` birthdays
- Saving posts

## What I learnt by this project

Especially I learnt how to create full stack application. I learnt working with **React** on a bigger project. 
I get familiar with (useState, refs, useEffect, Portals). Also I learnt the most inportant features of **Redux Toolkit**, 
which is much more understandable now. Of course, I used **react-routers(v6)** too, I learnt to use the most popular features of it. 
It's not everything, in the app I used a lot of packages, which are listed below.

I have to mention the huge progression with working with **MongoDb and Express**. Making this project required creating **Authentication** and quite big **API**. 
Building the project taught me how to structre my data in db to use in the app. It developed my way of thinking during creating backend for the app.
Now I am much more aware how does it work and find better solutions on the backend.

I learnt how to use Cloudinary...
